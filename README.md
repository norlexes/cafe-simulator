User Interface:

Start Screen
This is the start screen. This is where everything starts. When you run the code, this screen pops up.

Start button
This is the start button. When you press this button, you get redirected to the menu screen.


Menu Screen
This is the menu screen. This is where you select your menu for training and enter your name.

Name Registry 
This button is located in the middle of the screen and is where you enter their name. This provides you with a more personalized and authentic experience as workers in real-world cafés are identified by their names. 

Dropdown for Menus 
This is where you select the menu for the coffee you would like to practice making. Clicking the circled region below provides a display of the three menus this simulation offers practice on. 


Working Screen
This is the screen which contains the bulk of the functionality and where you will be doing your training. It contains several elements to give you all the information and interactivity you need in one convenient place.

Menu Panel	
After selecting the menu you want to prepare, this panel on the left side of the screen will inform you of the ingredients needed for the menu you selected. However, it does not say the order in which these ingredients need to go.

Coffee cup
This is the main graphical element, and is in the center of the screen. It is a computer visualization of what a cross section of the drink would look like as you were preparing it, to give you an in depth look at what is happening as you work.

Button 1 - Add Brewed Coffee
This is the top button on the right side of the screen. This is one of the ingredient buttons, and will add a light brown rectangle to your cup. The brewed coffee serves as an essential base for your drink.

Button 2 - Add Milk
This is the second button from the top on the right. This adds milk, which will be a white rectangle. Milk is important to round out your drink.

Button 3 - Add Espresso
The third button is from the top on the right. This adds espresso, which is a much darker element than the brewed coffee. The distinction between these two are important.

Button 4 - Empty Cup
So you messed up. But that's okay, this is a simulation, not real life! With this helpful button on the bottom of the right of the screen, you can empty the cup and start over. Unlike in real life, emptying the cup leads to no lost profits. Just don't do it once you get on the job.
